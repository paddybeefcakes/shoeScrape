The Fruity Pebbles edition of the LeBron 15 draws inspiration from the unreleased player exclusive, first seen on the Nike LeBron 4. The shoe features a multicolored BattleKnit upper, white accents, a full icy blue translucent outsole and the phrase “Family Size” embroidered on the inside of the tongue. These dropped in mens and kids sizes in March of 2018. This colorway is a must-have for all LeBron James fans.

Two years after the inaugural Mamba Day, the new Kobe 1 Protro brings technological innovation to the original Zoom Kobe 1 silhouette in a black/gold “Mamba Day” colorway. These shoes feature loads of Lakers easter eggs, from the OG Mamba Day date printed on the right heel of the shoes to the “XX” on the lace fixtures on the tongue as a nod to Kobe’s 20 years with the Lakers. Even the custom insoles depicts the Black Mamba walking out to the court again.

Another noticeable change is the placement of the Swoosh, which is embroidered near the upper heel as a nod to the Air Max 95's branding. Adding to the build up to Air Max Day 2018, these dropped in March of 2018. If you’re looking to keep it real ‘90s on the court, these are a must.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 196 - US$ 234",8.8,7.5

He predicted that his Philadelphia 76ers would win the NBA championship that year, after sweeping the competition throughout the Playoffs. His bold prediction almost came true, a lone loss to the Bucks altered his original “Fo, Fo, Fo” saying by one.

First releasing in November of 2017, the Yeezy Boost 700’s represented what was a significant shift in Kanye’s design aesthetic, moving from the minimalistic silhouettes of early Yeezy seasons to this chunky runner model. It once again showed how Kanye stays ahead of the curve, as chunkier sneakers became more en vogue in 2018. The shoe features an upper with grey and black suede overlays, premium leather with blue mesh underlays, neon green laces, and its signature chunky midsole with encapsulated Boost technology. Translation: these may look bold but are still comfy as hell. The Yeezy Wave Runners will stay at the same retail cost of $300 for the upcoming restock, but have averaged a sale price well above retail on StockX since their initial drop. So if you’re looking to add these to your Yeezy collection, remember that fortune favors the bold bidders.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 357 - US$ 401",5.7,26.3

This colorway steps outside of the comfort zone of previous 350 Yeezy sneaker releases, which have remained subtle and mostly neutral primary colors and bright accents. The official colorway of the 'Frozen Yellow Yeezys' is actually Semi Frozen Yellow, Raw Steel and Red and features both of adidas pinnacle technologies, Boost cushioning and Primeknit sock-like upper. The hype for the yellow colored Yeezys was pushed to the roof before launch as Kanye West appeared with Kid Cudi and Takashi Murakami as 'Ye and Cudi toured the iconic artist's studio on a trip to Tokyo. In addition, the rumors throughout the sneaker world suggested the Frozen Yellow Yeezy would be an extremely hard to get release. As expected, the Semi Frozen Yellow was announced officially on November 13th, 2017 and released in limited quantities on November 18th, 2017.

While previous Yeezy Boost 750 releases shared the colors, this version became affectionately known as the Chocolate Yeezy Boost 750. This Yeezy Boost colorway initially hit ""the internets"" months before the actual October 15th, 2016 release date and has a color palette from previous ""Yeezy Season"" apparel collections. Although many of the sneaker blogs showcased a version with a glow in the dark outsole. The shoes carried an initial retail price of $350 but as is the case with most of Kanye West's collaborations with adidas, the pre-release buzz pushed resell prices significantly higher. Time will tell if the ""Chocolate"" Yeezy Boost 750 Light Brown/Gum will be as popular as other Kanye West designs but as of now, this Yeezy Boost looks promising.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 413 - US$ 619",20,47.4

Shattered Backboard Air Jordan 1 Retro, also known as the
Shattered Backboard 2.0, follows up the first release with a new take
on the classic Jordan shoe. The legend of the colorway comes from the
fact that Michael Jordan shattered the backboard with one of his
iconic slam dunks on a Nike exhibition tour back in 1985. Jordan
actually played for both teams during the game, so the Reverse
Shattered Backboard Jordan 1 colorway only makes sense. However, the
backboard-breaking dunk came on the side that featured black and
orange jerseys. The second team wore white-based jerseys, which is
where this colorway gets tied into MJ's now infamous Italy stop. The
official colorway of the Jordan 1 Retro ""Reverse Shattered Backboard""
is Sail/Starfish-Black, which, as expected is the reverse of the
Black/Starfish-Sail release from June of 2015. With both colorways
celebrating the iconic moment from Jordan's rookie year, which is also
YouTube famous in its own right, the shattered backboard Jordan moment
is sure to live on for decades to come.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 488 - US$ 712",18.6,275

The white and gold colorway follows the style of the OVO Air Jordan 10 Retro, which also released in a black version. Beyond the colorway, Drake's OVO Jordan 12 has been aligned with his ""Summer Sixteen"" concert tour that has seen other hip hop artists like Kanye West, Future and Young Thug take the stage with Drizzy. Of course, the Air Jordan 12 is one of the most iconic Jordans that MJ ever laced up on the court thanks to performances like the ""Flu Game"" against the Utah Jazz. The original ""Rising Sun"" design was inspired by the Japanese flag and a creation from the legendary Nike/Jordan designer Tinker Hatfield. The white and gold Drake x Air Jordan 12 OVO released on October 1st and sold out with the quickness, which has caused resell prices to be higher than most initially anticipated.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 586 - US$ 714",9.9,188.9

This colorway is said to be one of the original versions of the Olympic inspired Air Jordan 7 designed by legendary Tinker Hatfield. Unlike the OG Olympic VII, the Tinker Alternate colorway features a contrasting Midnight Navy and white upper. The midsole also differs significantly from the original with a gradient pattern and the always popular paint splatter detailing. Michael Jordan may have never had the chance to wear this colorway back in the day but there is no doubt the red, white and blue proudly represents Team USA on the Tinker Alternate Air Jordan 7 Retro Olympics.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 123 - US$ 187",20.8,-18.4

Jordan Brand had been teasing the release of the Maroon VI for years and many decided not to believe it until they saw it. When pictures of the shoes leaked from China in July, the blogosphere went crazy. Finally, the very simple and elegant shoe would see its first retro release, in men's, GS, and PS sizing. Moreover, it would prominently feature 'Nike Air' on its heels. The Air Jordan 6 Retro Maroon was part of Nike's Retro Remaster initiative, which began in spring of 2015 series, and was said by The Swoosh to be as close to the original 1991 product from back in the day. What makes the Maroon 6 so special are its gorgeous off-white leather upper and sparse deep maroon red accents at the midsole and tongue. Additionally, Jordan Brand decided to give the Maroon 6 milky translucent hits on the outsole, rather than the icy blue traditioanlly found on a Jordan Retro 6. For the final touch, Jordan Brand made sure the box for the Jordan 6 Retro Maroon was designed just like the original from 1991.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 197 - US$ 237",9.1,-1.4

When Michael Jordan's first signature sneaker, the Air Jordan 1, debuted in 1985 nobody -- not even it's designer Peter Moore -- knew it would become such a phenomenon. The Air Jordan 1 Retro 30th Anniversary Laser debuted as part of the Laser Pack in February of 2015. Released alongside an Air Jordan 4 Retro and an Air Jordan 20 Retro done up in similar fashions, the inspiration for this pack was the pearl, the gift commonly given to mark a 30th anniversary. This Air Jordan 1 Retro was part of JB's remastered product offerings, flaunting premium leathers and laser-etched details all over the heel, toewrap, and eyestay. The lasered details celebrate the last three decades of Michael Jordan and his shoes, as well as the All-Star Game finally returning to New York in 2015 (Madison Square Garden hadn't hosted the game since 1998). Reflective details and the icy blue outsole keep this shoe subtle and highlight its intricately designed upper. The Air Jordan 1 Retro 30th Anniversary features a solid rubber cupsole with an Air unit embedded in the heel for cushioning and some of the best traction of all time. The Air Jordan 1 Retro only look better with every wear, so make sure these get some time in the streets.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 90 - US$ 222",42.1,-15.7

Over the years, BHM sneakers have changed dramatically from the basic Air Force 1 with flag stitched into the heel back in the day to the modern era which consists of a handful of releases from many of the major brands with matching apparel and accessories. For the 2015 Black History Month collection, Nike opted for a very simple formula, a black and white color scheme with a Kente cloth-inspired graphic to complement the colorway. The Jordan 1 BHM was a part of bigger collection of sneaker designs across basketball, football, running, soccer and skateboarding that honored six athletes and coaches who have positively impacted sport with their courage and determination: Theotis Beasley, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Jerry Rice, Brianna Rollins, C. Vivian Stringer and John Thompson. Like most of the Black History Month sneaker releases, the Air Jordan 1 BHM helped raise awareness and a portion of proceeds from the sale of the 2015 BHM Collection go to the Ever Higher Fund. Although it is more limited than many realize, the 2015 Air Jordan 1 Retro High BHM never caught on in popularity the way that traditional Jordan 1 Retro colorways have.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 126 - US$ 174",16.1,15.4

If you were to describe the trends of 2015 in three words, they would probably be “black and white.” That said, the Cyber Monday Air Jordan 1 was on point. The Monday after Black Friday has become known as Cyber Monday for all of the Internet sales that are processed on that day. Nike, like many brands, created products and sales especially for the day and as we habitual buyers are, we bought. But even if the Cyber Monday Jordan 1 released on any other day of the year, the monochromatic black and white colorway is simple and wearable. It also features the High OG subtitle, which means this Jordan 1 Retro is true to original form with the ever-important “Nike Air” branding on the tongue and the original high cut ankle. Although the Jordan 1 “Cyber Monday” was a simple color combo, Nike upped the ante by using premium materials, including the black leather upper and a mesh inner lining. Though not as noticeable from a distance, an up close look reveals the old school Jordan Wings logo embossed into the leather. The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG “Cyber Monday” released on November 30th, 2015 and retailed for $160 with an official colorway of Black/White-Dark Grey.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 115 - US$ 171",19.4,-10.6

It isn't often that a brand has an excellent second shoe so soon after releasing the very first sig for a new athlete. Using a multicolored build and gradient upper, from pink at the toe to purple at the heel, this shoe is a neckbreaker. The UA Curry 2 is quite light at just around 13 ounces in a men's size 9. The bright green accents on the tongue, heel, and laces match the outsole and contrast nicely with the basic white heel. Under Armour's Speedform upper, the main difference from the Curry One's Anafoam upper, provids a soft yet snug fit and the synthetic material on the toe-half provides support and durability. If you like a little room in the toe you'll want to go up half a size, and if you're playing ball in these they'll more than have you covered; the lockdown is supreme, UA's Charged cushion will will give you great court feel, the outrigger will keep you from slipping over, and with the excellent multi-directional herringbone traction you'll beat your defender every time.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 70 - US$ 102",18.3,-61.8

Instantly a fan-favorite, the Air Jordan Future stole the hearts of sneakerheads with its modern-day look and classic Air Jordan 11 tooling.

All inspired by their respective cities, the Air Max 1 Ultra City Collection ""Milan"" was created in women's sizes and floral print. For the Nike Air Max 1 Milan, the theme was lilies and plum blossoms atop a green and golden background. Reflective of the buildings throughout Milan, the tongue and laces of the Air Max One were golden and was finished by a classic gum bottom. Against the greenish-gold background were bright white lilies with blue centers accented by pink plum blossoms which truly popped on the London AM1. Each of the other cities in the City Pack were also representative of their inspiring metropolis and used different flowers and colors to show their style and tradition. Retailing at $180, the AM1 Milan were released in March, 2015 at Nike Sportswear accounts in each of the represented cities for International Women's Day and later at NSW accounts worldwide. The Nike Air Max 1 City Pack ""Milan"" represents the history of Milan as well as the beauty of the female mind and spirit through its bright and bold graphics.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 156 - US$ 204",13.3,NA

The Air Max 1 Ultra City Pack ""Shanghai"" was created in women's sizes and floral print. The Nike Air Max 1 Shanghai was represented by lilies and plum blossoms against a black tongue and sock liner. Beneath the upper, the white midsole and red outsole work well to both lighten the deep red upper but also create some vibrant as the toe wraps upward from the bottom. The red hues on the Shanghai AM1 make it more difficult to distinguish the floral-patterned usage than its pack-mates, yet are still apparent upon closer inspection. Each of the other cities in the City Pack were also representative of their inspiring municipalities and each used varying flowers and colors to show their style and tradition. Retailing at $180, the AM1 Shanghai released in March, 2015 at the Nike Sportswear accounts in each of the pack's cities for International Women's Day and were later available at NSW accounts worldwide. The Nike Air Max 1 City Pack ""Shanghai"" shows the bold history on its inspirational city though the use of reds and blacks, one of the most desired palettes in sneakers.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 179 - US$ 219",NA,10.6

In a traditional that had just recently been started, Nike was celebrating March 26th as its annual nod to one of its most prized lines, the Air Max. Much like its recent pack-mates earlier in the month, the Paris Patch 1 used a hyerfuse no-sew paneling from the heel, all around the shoe. Acting as the mud guard, the hyperfuse gave subtlety to the toe box, in an effort to tone-down the dimension of the shoe. That is because that heel and tongue of the shoe featured velcro paneling, allowing for the use of several patches included with the shoe to be put on however the wearer chose. Giving the wearer the ability to customize their look and pay homage to whatever NikeLab city or Nike heritage price they wanted was something truly unique. With a retail price of $120, the Nike Air Max 1 V SP ""Paris"" Patch sold out extremely quickly. The light grey and deep navy upper panels allowed buyers to wear their customized creations in any season.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 141 - US$ 249",27.7,50

This Bred AM1, however, gets a colorway and material options that most sneakerheads will find familiar from another type of sneaker, the Air Jordan 1. From a distance, the black and red, or “bred” for short, color combo looks rather simple but a closer look at the leather upper reveals a very unique detail, not found on any other Air Max 1. The Bred Air Max 1 features the Nike Air logo embossed in the heel, and not on the rear of the shoe as is customary. Instead, Nike Sportswear opted to place it on the lateral heel side of this AM1.

Released exclusively within the United States, the Purple Tape N.9000 were accompanied by a slew of different Diadora, New Era, and Packer clothes and accessories. Unique to a Raekwon collab, the Purple Tapes included the track list for his album ""Only Built 4 Cubna Linx"" on the insoles.

With a retail price of $200, the Purple Tapes were available at S.O.B.'s on August 20th then later available online on the 22nd. The first 95 lucky purchases at the in-store release we afforded tickets to the Purple Tape 20th Anniversary show later that evening.

After a trip to Japan, Tokyo quickly became RF's favorite city in the world, partly because of the Sakura Puma's inspiration, the cherry blossom. Starting out as a white then transforming into a faint pink, before turning to deep cherry red, the cherry blossom only blooms for 7-10 days of the year, but during those days, those in Tokyo revere the tree for it's beauty, just as sneaker enthusiasts do the Sakura R698. Constructed of lush microperforated pigskin suede throughout the upper, with a deep red toe box, the Cherry Blossom Pumas featured a gradient midsole that faded from the toe back to the mid-foot from the deep red to white. This was the first time that Ronnie Fieg had ever used a gradient midsole on one of his projects, and it is fitting he did so with the Japanese Cherry R698 as he truly captured the evolution of their blossom.

Like the higher cut version, the Curry One uses two of Under Armour’s most trusted technologies, anaFoam for the dimpled upper and Charged Foam cushioning throughout the midsole. The perfect storm of performance and popularity helped the Curry One become UA’s most popular basketball sneaker and push the brand’s footwear sales to new levels. The Dub Nation Low dropped alongside the Panthers colorway, inspired by Steph’s favorite football team, in the early days of summer.

Of course, with Curry’s performance on the court, which included a record amount of 3-pointers, a 3-point contest win, a league Most Valuable Player award, and NBA championship, the Curry One helped UA sell a record number of shoes during its inaugural year. In addition to Steph’s performance, UA’s anaFoam breathable and lightweight upper and Charged Foam cushioning helped earn the Curry One a lot of respect from sneaker YouTubers. Although, the UAA Finals Curry Low was one of the more lowkey releases in the Curry One lineup, its colors definitely turn heads. Despite the loud colors, the Under Armour Curry Low “UAA Finals” didn’t create much buzz amongst the sneaker blogs, though you can bet any of the players in the Under Armour Association surely appreciated their pair.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 2 - US$ 78",95.8,-63.6

Curry’s first signature model from UA and his success on court since joining Under Armour in 2013 has helped the brand’s basketball footwear business tremendously. While the black and red UA Curry 1 Low may not have an elaborate storyline behind it, red has always been a popular color for basketball shoes since they became a global phenomenon in the early 90s. Of course, Steph Curry becoming the first athlete to win a title in his very first signature sneaker also helps make the Curry One historic no matter the colorway. The performance reviews of the Curry One have also helped make it one of the most sought after shoes for hoopers around the world. The Curry One Low features Charged Foam cushioning beneath the black and white speckled midsole. A similar colorway of the Curry One Low was also worn by Kent Bazemore during the 2014-2015 season where the primary colors were flipped top to bottom. The Under Armour Curry One Low “Red/Black” originally released in NYC and was followed by a widespread release in late 2015.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 72 - US$ 88",10.2,-27.3

Although the MVP version of the UA Curry One featured black and gold, you could call the all black upper and gold details of the Black and Gold Banner Curry One the Away MVP. The Black and Gold Banner Curry One released as one of a few celebratory colorways to honor Stephen Curry’s accomplishments during the 2014-2015 NBA season. And what a season it was. Curry not only received his first signature sneaker from Under Armour, but he also earned the Most Valuable Player award for the regular season and led the Warriors to their first NBA championship in 40 years. Maybe the anaFoam upper and Charged Foam cushioning of the UA Curry One helped him make all that happen, or maybe not. Maybe it’s his faith, which was honored on the tongue of the Black and Gold Banner Curry with “4:13” a reference to the Bible verse Curry writes on every pair of sneakers he wears on court. Regardless, his first signature sneaker from UA took the brand to levels nobody expected and the Under Armour Curry One “Black and Gold Banner” celebrates those accomplishments properly.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 83 - US$ 129",21.9,-11.7

The most aggressive iteration of the Asics Gel-Lyte III thus far, Bait dressed this shoe in some of the most premium materials allowed; tilapia skin suede, in concert with scaled reptile suede, envelope the upper while rich full-grain leather from the tanneries of Japan hit the vamp and formstripes. Caged by silver metal mesh with 3M hexagons, the quarter harkens back to previous Bait Asics GL3 builds. Interestingly, this time the infamous split tongue on the Gel Lyte III (that some love and some hate) is split between black wire mesh and silver wire mesh and underlayed with Bait branded reflective 3M panels. The guts of the Asics Gel Lyte III Bait Nightmare are coated in premium black leather and the classic white midsole gets a black speckle for some pop. The unique insoles are dual-branded with metallic hits and the best details on this shoe may be the outsoles. Done up with translucent rubber for effect, the outsoles reveal the bold Asics and Bait branding beneath them.

Fieg found his inspiration after a trip to Tokyo where he was able to experience the blooming of the cherry blossoms that later inspired his Puma Sakura collection. Not only was RF inspired by the beauty of the trees themselves, but he was also inspired by the people who gave thanks and offered much respect for nature during that time. After the beginning of the bloom, the cherry blossom eventually transitions from a deep cherry color into a darkly-hued blue. Composed of premium microperforated pigskin suede, with a beautiful navy nubuck toe box, the Cherry Blossom Pumas featured a gradient midsole that faded from the toe back to the mid-foot from the navy to cherry. Not only was this a new model from Ronnie Fieg and Puma that extended the original Puma R698 upwards into a mid, it was also that the first time that Ronnie Fieg had ever used a gradient midsole on one of his projects.

"6896","2015","other-sneakers",180,"CURY1-UNDERDOG","UA Curry 1 Underdog","Size 8","The Under Armour Curry One “Underdog” colorway pays homage to Steph’s college, Davidson and the fact that he was overlooked and often viewed as an underdog coming out of college. Although Steph Curry set the record for most 3-pointers made in an NCAA season, becoming the all-time leading scoring at Davidson College, and being drafted in the 7th pick in the NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors, the world slept on Steph Curry. Curry has always been viewed as the underdog, Under Armour decided to use that as inspiration (and maybe a little motivation) for this Davidson-esque color scheme. Davidson’s official colors are black and red, which is the combination seen on this UA Curry One, along with a touch of silver and grey, nicknamed “Underdog” colorway. The Underdog Curry One comes with expected details like the anaFoam upper and Charged Foam cushioning, and also features a grey midsole with black splattered paint that harkens back to some of the most popular sneaker designs of the late 80s. But the Underdog nickname may be even more relevant to the battle in basketball shoes between UA and Nike, where Under Armour is steadily making a name for themselves in a business dominated by Nike. Whether the nickname began for Steph or for UA, the Under Armour Curry One “Underdog” is fitting for a signature shoe that changed the entire perspective of many sneaker enthusiasts.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 159 - US$ 201",11.6,50

After Curry was seen playing in the Splash Party Curry One a few times, it was rumored that a release would make the thought-to-be player exclusive available to fans. Then Steph laced up the Splash Party Curry One in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, solidifying the need for Warriors fans and sneaker collectors to have a pair. The Curry One Splash Party released as a part of the “Championship” Curry One pack in October of 2015 in extremely limited quantities and then UA followed up in November with a release of the Splash Party Curry on its own in November.

The bill itself was such an inspiration that it is printed on the custom insoles of the Lira N.9000. Using incredibly high quality suede, the upper blends together a mix of pastels and tonal beige to create the effect of the 500,000 Italian bill. Furthermore, rather than the traditional N.9000 adorning the lateral side of the rear shoe panel, instead the Lira dons 500000. The Diadora branding is instead relocated to the back heel and is stitched in green reflective 3M against the green suede heel panel and light blue heel tab. Rope laces and a mixed grey and salmon outsolde finish off the shoe agains a white, pale yellow and salmon-hit midsole. Released only via Concepts online web shop and in-store at their Cambridge, Massachusetts location, the Lira Diadora retailed for $200.

The Curry One is Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry’s first signature sneaker from Under Armour after joining UA’s athlete roster in 2013. The “Away” version of the Curry One gets its nickname because it was the colorway that was pretty much the go-to choice for Curry’s road games during the 2014-2015 NBA season. The Under Armour Curry featured a single color applied to most versions but the Away Curry One featured a camo design across the “anaFoam” upper.

Although, that didn’t prevent the Away Curry 1 from selling. Although that might have something to do with Curry’s performance on the court. After all, Stephen Curry became the first NBA player to win an NBA title while wearing his very first signature sneaker.

The colorway was one of the first to embrace the Knicks team colors, which as most sneakerheads know, was taboo at the time and in some cases even against the rules of the NBA. Nevertheless, Patrick Ewing led the Knicks into the playoffs on a regular basis, most of the time sporting the Three Stripes while destroying opponents at Madison Square Garden. Later, Ewing would eventually become the first player to be a majority owner of his own footwear line with Ewing Athletics but the old school 'heads will always have a love for Ewing's Knicks-inspired colorway of the adidas Attitude that dates back all the way to 1986.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 93 - US$ 127",15.4,10

One of the most iconic elements of the Air Jordan 5 is its 3M reflective tongue. Taking that as a starting point, the Air Jordan 5Lab3 reinvents the timeless AJ3 silhouette with a design that is almost entirely reflective. The black upper, minus the stitching, Jumpman logo and lace holes, is all reflective, making it one of the most Instagram-worthy retro Jordans of 2014. Beneath the reflective upper a black midsole and icy blue translucent outsole added some more flashiness to the AJ3 5Lab3. While Michael Jordan never wore this Jordan 3 colorway, the reflective elements celebrate the ingenuity of Tinker Hatfield’s Jordan 5 design and tie the old and new together for sneaker enthusiasts both young and old. Like any non-OG colorway, there is always an initial denial from the purists of Air Jordan collectors, but the black 5Lab3 Jordan 3 seemed to be too good for that attitude towards it to last long. By the time the Air Jordan III 5Lab3 released it had pretty much sold out in a matter of days.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 152 - US$ 182",9.2,-25.8

The Black Cement Jordan 3 is, to many, is the greatest sneaker of all time. The design was first introduced in 1988 and came from the mind of the most famous sneaker designer, Tinker Hatfield. Over 25 years later, a royal blue variation of the black based Air Jordan 3 finally made its way to retail shelves. While the purists will still hold out for an OG colorway, the 2014 release of the “Sport Blue” Jordan 3 had just enough of the traditional AJ3 elements to sell through. A black upper, contrasted with the grey and black Elephant Print design that has become one of the most important design elements in sneaker history, and this AJ3 is on its way. A translucent blue outsole, Sport Blue inner lining and midsole that is also half-wrapped in matching blue tied the design together. Sneakerheads might have shunned the colorway at first but that didn’t stop the Sport Blue AJ3 from finding its way onto the feet of celebrities like Jay-Z, Freddie Gibbs, DJ Khaled and countless others. What makes the Jordan 3 Retro “Sport Blue” colorway legit is that if it were to have been released during MJ’s Wizards days, he’d have definitely worn a pair on court.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 195 - US$ 215",5.1,20.6

Infrared 23 made its way onto a handful of sneakers that year and as one of the retro Jordans that were being produced, the Air Jordan 3 got its taste of the “new” Infrared color. Like the original Jordan 3 from 1988, designed by Tinker Hatfield as the shoe that kept Michael Jordan with Nike, the “Infrared 23” Jordan 3 features the iconic Elephant Print wrapped around the toe box and surrounding the heel at the rear of the shoe. Combined with the white upper, the design feels very “White Cement” but that’s where the Infrared 23 takes a different turn. The top portion of the shoe and the tongue under the laces, is done in black along with the inner lining. A black outsole and upper midsole are also used, leaving just two places for the Infrared 23 accents, the lace holes and inside the visible Air unit in the heel. Though it’s not an original colorway the tastefully done Air Jordan 3 Retro “Infrared 23” does a good job honoring the past without feeling like the same old colorways.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 201 - US$ 245",9.8,31.2

The Air Jordan “Lab Series” was created as a way for Jordan to tell stories of multiple Air Jordan models in a unique way. For the AJ3 5Lab3, the reflective upper of Air Jordan III “5Lab3” is doused in a reflective and metallic-like silver finish that originated in the Air Jordan line on the 1990 released Air Jordan 5. Though 3M reflective material had made its way onto running shoes of the era, Tinker Hatfield added it to the tongue of the Air Jordan V and as they say, the rest is history. With the entire upper of Jordan III “5Lab3” made up of reflective material, it’s no surprise the Instagram-focused nature of sneakerheads helped make this one of the most seen Jordan 3s of 2014. While it might not be an OG colorway for the purists, the 5Lab3 Air Jordan 3 definitely struck a chord with its unmistakable brightness and clear outsole that had sneaker vets reminiscing on that sample pair of Kobe 3s from back in the day. The Air Jordan 3 5Lab3 “Reflective Silver” dropped in March of 2014 and restocked a handful of times throughout the following months.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 113 - US$ 157",15.9,-40

CP3 is a long time endorser of Jordan Brand and has debuted player edition Jordans on plenty of occasions. However the Air Jordan 1 Retro “CP3” was one of the first to have an actual public release. The Chris Paul Jordan 1 features a combination of blue hues over a white base that is reminiscent of colorways seen on the feet of North Carolina Tarheels players. The official colorway of the AJ1 High Chris Paul edition is Midnight Navy/University Blue-White but the extra details like Chris Paul’s “CP3” logo on the tongue and the subtle white Jumpman logo stitched into the heel make it more unique than what is seen at first glance. A mesh collar around the ankle is also a break from the normal AJ1 releases. Whether you’re a CP3 fan or not the University Blue Wings logo and Swoosh on the side, combined with the white toebox and Midnight Navy blue nubuck upper makes this color appealing. The Air Jordan 1 High Retro “Chris Paul” edition released alongside player editions for other Jordan Brand athletes like Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook and Blake Griffin and was even seen on the feet of Chris Paul at one of his bowling tournaments.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 184 - US$ 246",14.5,65.4

The original Air Jordan 3 became famous because of Michael Jordan’s NBA Slam Dunk title and unbelievable performance on the court. Subsequently the stories that have been told over the years about how MJ was looking to leave Nike and Tinker Hatfield’s AJ3 design saved him from jumping ship added to that allure, making the Air Jordan 3 one of the most popular models in the Jordan line, not just for basketball but for off the court. The Wolf Grey Jordan 3 fall into that same category thanks to tasteful color palette and subtle unique details. The nubuck upper of the Wolf Grey Jordan 3 is like that of many other non-OG Retro 3 colorways. The black accents make it an easy choice for sneakerheads and for those not trying to stand out with a bright colorway. However the most unique detail on the Jordan 3 Wolf Grey is the chrome finish on the Elephant Print, which of course made some people hate it, while being a feature never seen before, made others a fan of the colorway. The Air Jordan 3 Retro “Wolf Grey” was one of the few Jordan 3 versions that didn’t sell out right away but eventually did and even sold through on a few restocks as well.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 131 - US$ 161",10.1,-14.1

The thing about colorways that makes or breaks a Jordan release is the story behind it. The more powerful stories will always include Michael Jordan’s playing days because that’s where this crazy sneaker thing of ours began. Jordan 1s have been released in various Chicago Bulls inspired colorways since the beginning but the Carmine Jordan 1 had a unique twist. You see, the “Carmine” colorway, officially known as “White/Carmine-Black” was originally from the Air Jordan 6. Jordan Brand took inspiration from that colorway to create the Jordan 1 Carmine, which features the deep red suede paneling and white leather, as well as the translucent outsole that originated on the AJ6. Like most of the Jordan 1s released throughout 2013, the Carmine 1s received the “OG” treatment of the traditional high-top cut and Nike Air branding on the tongue and insoles. One tiny detail on this Jordan Retro 1 that stands out, due to the icy outsole and white midsole, is the contrast stitching that holds the midsole to the upper. Despite the familiar color blocking, the Air Jordan Retro 1 High OG Carmine didn’t sell as well as other colorways initially but was tough to find for anything less than retail not long after its May release.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 217 - US$ 253",7.6,67.9

Notable details on this Air Jordan 1 Retro include the pinstriped inner lining and reflective laces. While this isn't the first Air Jordan to pay homage to Jordan's time with the Barons (Jordan Brand did so in 2008 with the ""Home and Away"" pack), it does carry the story of Michael Jordan's chase to fulfill a wish of his late father: seeing MJ play baseball. The Air Jordan 1 was designed by Peter Moore and originally released in 1985. It featured a solid rubber cupsole with an Air unit embedded in the heel for cushioning and some of the best traction of all time. Interestingly, the original retail price for the Air Jordan 1 in 1985 was only $65 USD -- adjusted for inflation, that is approximately $140 in today's money. To celebrate the times with Michael Jordan off the hardwood, the Air Jordan 1 Retro Barons is your best bet.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 328 - US$ 406",10.5,162.1

This version of the Jordan 1 didn’t fly off the shelves in the way some of the traditionally colored AJ1s might, but aside from a few small restocks, it was difficult to get ahold of a pair within a day or two of its original December 6th, 2014 release date. The Nike Air on the tongue and insole gives the Jordan 1-- officially colored Black/Gum Light Brown/Black --its OG title, as compared to other Jordan 1s with the Jumpman on the tongue and insole. While the monochrome black upper is a mix of both smooth leather and a textured variation.

Back when Air Jordans began to become popular, Michael Jordan’s alma mater was often the inspiration for colorways. The original Jordan 9 and Jordan 10 were both created in “Powder Blue” variations that were eventually worn by players on the Tarheels team. Some 20 years later, the Air Jordan 3 Retro arrives in a “Dark Powder Blue” upper that screams UNC. What makes the Powder Blue Jordan 3 Retro quite unique is the way the Elephant Print is used. Of course the traditional placement of the toe surround and wrapped around the heel features the light blue with black print, but the Wolf Grey color of the inner lining also featured a subtle Elephant Print design on the Powder Blue Retro 3s. The official colorway for the “Powder Blues” is Dark Powder Blue/Black-Wolf Grey-White and even though it’s not an original colorway, the unique details and North Carolina-like color scheme made the Powder Blue AJ3 one of the most anticipated releases of the new year when it released in January of 2014.

Well, the Air Jordan 1 Retro Blake Griffin PE that was released in 2015 definitely sweetens the deal for Los Angeles Clippers star and former NBA Slam Dunk Contest winner, Blake Griffin. BG initially signed with Jordan Brand back in 2012 after initially signing with Nike out of college. His contract with Jordan Brand meant becoming the face of the Jordan Super.Fly, but when he’s not emulating the Jumpman logo in pre-game warm ups, Blake has his own player edition Air Jordan 1. The Blake Griffin Jordan 1 launch date was shuffled last minute when it originally released, which may have initially kept this colorway from pushing numbers the way other Jordan 1s do out of the gate. The Jordan 1 Blake Griffin edition came in a familiar colorway of Gym Red/Black-White but featured a nubuck-like upper surrounding the leather toebox and a mesh tongue, something you don’t see often on the Air Jordan 1. However, there is something else that made this AJ1 unique and significantly different than others. The Air Jordan 1 Retro High Blake Griffin PE features the “BG” logo for Blake on the tongue, which makes it a must have any real Blake fan.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 131 - US$ 189",18.3,23.1

Bo Jackson was a true rarity, a dual-sport professional athlete with mastery on the gridiron and on the diamond. However, Jackson did far more than just football and baseball -- his ads showed him surfing, playing cricket, and most important for this Air Trainer III, competitive horse racing. The colors on this iconic Nike cross trainer (Bo Jackson can be credited with almost single-handedly creating the cross training footwear genre) are plucked from Bo's pink and yellow jockey outfit. The Nike Air Trainer 3 Bo Knows Horse Racing showcases its theme with the duo of pixelated logos on the tongue and heel; one sports Bo's now-retired collegiate number while the other flaunts a horse and jockey team. The tonal grey upper and translucent plastic heel cage allow for the pink and yellow accents to pop, while the grey speckles against the black midsole add character. Launched originally at the beginning of May, 2014, this Nike Air Trainer 3 is a certified neckbreaker that the sneaker community won't soon forget.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 65 - US$ 105",23.1,-34.6

Originally released in 1987, the Air Max 1 design is one of Tinker Hatfield’s best and has become a standard model on the walls of retailers since the early 90s. The Air Max 1 Flax released alongside two other classic silhouettes with the same color palette, the Air Force 1 Mid and Air Trainer 1, in November of 2014. As images hit the web, the buzz seemed to be that the “Flax Pack” would be limited and the response was generally good and often referred to as the “Wheat” pack due to the similarity of the iconic Timberland Boot colorway. The Flax Air Max 1 is officially colored Flax/Baroque Brown-Flax and features a soft nubuck upper and boot inspired laces. Along with a brown midsole and gum outsole, the inspiration for this Air Max 1 made it a clear choice for collectors. The Nike Flax collection also garnered the attention of athletes and celebs like Victor Cruz, DeMarcus Cousins and Bow Wow, among others. The buzz around the pack and its simple colorblocking made the Nike Air Max 1 Flax a popular release and one that was easy to wear.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 158 - US$ 242",21,53.8

"7452","2014","nike",216,"TRANSC-BROKBAT","Air Trainer SC Broken Bats","Size: 10.5","Launched in early-2014, the Nike Air Trainer SC High Broken Bats celebrated Bo Jackson's ability to break bats -- both from his swinging prowess within the batter's box to his frustration when his swings were unfortuitous; notoriously, he would break bats right across his leg when he was upset. From his first at bat in 1986, Bo Jackson was a dual-sport (baseball and football) phenomenon. The Nike Air Trainer SC, along with many other Nike silhouettes like the Nike Air Trainer 1, were made incredibly popular with the infamous 'Bo Knows' Nike ad campaigns. According to some, the 'Bo Knows' advertisements were actually more popular than Jordan's Nike ads. This Broken Bats Nike Air Trainer SC High tells Bo's story through this Kansas City-inspired colorway. A woodgrain print in grey coats some of the white perforated leather upper, yet the key details are the icy blue outsoles with 'BROKEN BATS' that appear beneath them. The digitized Bo Jackson logo is prominently featured on both tongues and matches the digitzed number 16 at the heels. Nike is fond of telling stories to go along with shoes and the Nike Air Trainer SC High Broken Bats tells an incredibly nostalgic tale excellently.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 181 - US$ 251",16.4,72.8

Bright neon and purple splashed across the black upper and combined with a set of red laces and Nike’s iconic Safari print made these hard to miss. The crazy Air Trainer Max colorway earned the “What The” label, which does combine a few classic colors from previous Trainer Max 94 releases but it might have been from the overtly obnoxious colorway. The iconic training sneaker from Nike marked the end of an era as the career of Bo Jackson came to an end and a transition to trainers that had a much more basketball inspired feel began in the mid 90s. The Nike Air Trainer Max 94, also referred to as the Trainer Max2, features a Huarache-like sockliner, dual Swoosh logos on the side and Nike’s unparalleled Air Max cushioning. The Safari covered Nike Air Trainer Max 94 “What The Trainer” was a widespread release and made its way around the sneaker blogs thanks to being spotted on the feet of celebrities like Trinidad James.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 191 - US$ 269",16.9,64.3

"7459","2014","nike",250,"AM1-AMDAY","Air Max 1 Air Max Day 3.26","Size 8","In 2014, Nike declared March 26th, Air Max Day and creating the Nike Air Max 1 “Air Max Day/3.26” colorway of the iconic running shoe. Inspired by the Pompidou Center in Paris, known for its “inside-out” design, Tinker Hatifeld decided to make Air cushioning visible on the Air Max in 1987. While the marketing side of Nike was against visible Air cushioning, Tinker pushed forward and Nike created what is now one of the most important sneaker technologies ever made. The original white, grey and red colorway of the Air max 1 was also inspired by Tinker’s time in Paris and became the first release of the Air Max 1 back in 1987. As Nike declared 3.26 as the official Air Max Day in 2014, the original colorway was given a new twist thanks to a yellow midsole and underside of the tongue. The official colorway of the 3.26 Air Max 1 is Sail/University Red-Natural Grey and released on the same day that Air Max Day was announced complete with the date boldly pronounced on the tongue and Neon Nike logos stitched into the unique insoles. While the versions released at retail came in a more traditional box, a small amount of promotional pairs came in “Air” packaging. Nike also celebrated the Nike Air Max 1 “Air Max Day/3.26” release with Air Max Day apparel and a huge social media campaign.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 203 - US$ 297",18.8,100

Release alongside an ASICS GT-II dubbed the ""Brazil,"" the USA (or ""Gold Medal"") GL3 definitely did their intended purpose and stood out among contenders. One of the most unique aspects of the KFE release was Fieg's Kith pop-up shop in São Paulo that coincided with the World Cup. Kith also did a surprise online release of the USA GEL Lyte 3 that corresponded with the first goal that team USA scored during the World Cup. Interestingly enough, team USA scored historically early into their match and many people mistakenly believed that it coincided with the start of the game, rather than the opening goal. The USA Gel Lyte itself is a reflection of the year's worth of worth that RF and his team put into the KFE project. The Gold Medal dons red accents while the right shoe, navy, and although slightly different, the two work harmoniously together as a pair. From its pigskin leather sock liner to its nearly completely golden-leather upper, the Ronnie Fieg x Asics Gel-Lyte III ""USA"" screamed premium and quality at a $185 price-point. And although the secondary market doesn't reflect the work and thought that RF put into their release, the Gold Medal, KFE, GLIII was an extremely well-executed release.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 97 - US$ 143",19.5,-35.1

Using the best, most premium materials possible, the White Achromatic XT2 featured incredible, plush Italian leather on the upper and sock liner. RF did not want to draw-in consumers with a brand name but rather solely with materials and sleek design; something that most brands would shutter at. Offered in a custom Puma box with additional pig leather dust and lace bags, the RF White Achromatic also came with a set of round and a set of flat tonal laces, each with metal aglets. The White RF Achromatic boasted solid white on the upper, mid and outsoles. Incredibly wearable, the rich materials and nearly-complete lack of branding set this White Puma XT-2 apart. Retailing at $180 dollars, even while using Italian leathers, the White XT2 were available as part of a pack with a combo black-and-white pair via Kith pop-up shop in New York, both Kith NYC locations, and online. Limited numbers were also available from Dover Street Market and their DSM e-shop. A huge shift from his past works, the Ronnie Fieg x Puma XT-2 ""Achromatic-White"" is still able to find its place amongst other great RF release based solely on materials and design.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 87 - US$ 113",13.1,-44.4

"7632","2014","other-sneakers",40,"KAM2-EASTR","Reebok Kamikaze II Easter","Size: 12","The Reebok Kamikaze II “Easter” gave a classic design a new twist when it released in 2014. The original Reebok Kamikaze line was a signature sneaker line for 6-time NBA All Star Shawn Kemp of the Seattle Supersonics. The Kamikaze II was the version he wore during the 1995-1996 NBA season and was one of the most popular Reebok basketball shoes of the late 90s thanks to its Hexalite cushioning and contrasting color patterns that made it easily recognizable. The head-turning design of the Kamikaze II took a different direction when it received a modern remake with the “Easter” version. The Easter Kamikaze II design--officially colored Jadite/Utopic Teal/White/Electrolyte Yellow--features a subtle mix of pastel tones that will have you thinking about hunting for Easter eggs rather than playing basketball. The textured upper, teal suede overlay panel, and subtle yellow speckles on the midsole made this one of the most unique Kamikaze II colorways Reebok has ever made. With its low key colorway and limited marketing efforts behind it, the Easter Kamikaze released somewhat off the radar. Though it may be a far cry from the original colorways, the Reebok Kamikaze II “Easter” gave sneaker enthusiasts a new perspective on this classic design from Reebok.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 31 - US$ 49",21.5,-60

The Innercity Pumas gained inspiration from bustling inner city with an upper reflective of the dark black asphalt of city streets and a sock liner like the lights knifing through the dark city skies. The Inner City XS850 featured 3M reflective black and grey mesh underlays with soft black leather overlays wrapping around the toe, through the eye stays and around the back heel. The light glistens off the the mesh of the Innercity XS850 like the headlights rolling down the streets of a metropolitan. A soft white midsole lies below the asphalt-colored upper, yet is broken up by light grey near the heel. Finished with a black rubber outsole, the XS850 Inner City paints the picture of a concrete jungle. Not a highly-anticipated release, the Innercity XS850 was still able to find its way into the hearts of many urban sneaker lovers with its inspiration so clearly conveyed. Originally retailing for a price of £90, the Wilderness Pack Inner Cities were released alongside the ""Sahara"" R698.

The Rougarou is a story that originates from the early French settlers of the southern Louisiana region and tells of a cursed cajun man that turns into a werewolf that patrols the wetlands with evil intentions, attacking those that do not follow particular religious practices. It’s this legend that inspired Louisiana based boutique, Sneaker Politics, to design a werewolf inspired Reebok Pump Fury. The blood thirsty werewolf comes to life with the Pump Fury thanks to a brown fur upper resting below a black nylon Pump bladder cage. A dark green midsole and accents on the upper are tied together with red accents give this Sneaker Politics Pump Fury one of the most unique material and colorway makeups this Reebok design has ever seen. The Reebok Insta Pump Fury x Sneaker Politics “Rougarou” released as a part of the 20th anniversary series of Insta Pumps and disappeared from stores as quickly as the victims of the terrifying Rougarou itself when it released in April of 2014.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 68 - US$ 83",NA,-55.9

Social Status opted to take the Hornets inspiration to the next level by using photo-realistic prints across the upper of their 20th anniversary Reebok Pump Fury. The purple Pump cage lays over the top of honeycomb graphics but these aren’t the “Hex-a-lite” honeycombs you’re used to seeing on a pair of Reeboks. These honeycomb graphics are printed in a realistic looking way and then colored in that Charlotte Hornets aqua hue that many have come to love. The Hornets Pump Fury also features a teal and purple midsole and teal leather heel that proudly displays the Social Status logo. The Social Status x Reebok Insta Pump Fury OG “Hornets” released in July of 2014 and the timing could not have been better because the NBA’s Charlotte franchise officially changed their name from the Bobcats back to the Hornets in the season that started just a few months later.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 167 - US$ 229",15.6,13.1

"7718","2014","other-sneakers",360,"INSTA-ANGRYBRD","Reebok Instapump Fury Crooked Tongues ""The Angry Bird""","Size: 10","Although Crooked Tongues is no longer around, their collaborations remain some of the most collected sneakers, and this Crooked Tongues x Reebok Pump Fury “The Angry Bird” from 2014 is a prime example. The Angry Bird nickname comes from one of the inspirations for this Pump Fury OG, the macaw. The macaw parrot hails from South America and is one of the most colorful birds in the world. There’s no relation to the game Angry Birds, other than of course, the crazy strength of the macaw’s beak and apparent temperament. Another part of the inspiration for this design was the 1994 World Cup, which Brazil won, and Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos's self-designed 1994 goalie shirts. The CT x Reebok Pump Fury features a blue and green base with red, yellow and orange accents spread across the upper in the form of feather-like graphics. The original Reebok Insta Pump Fury design came from the mind of designer Steven Smith back in 1994, which ties the theme together nicely. This Crooked Tongues version released in 2014 as a part of a year long collaboration celebration for the Insta Pump’s 20th anniversary. The Crooked Tongues x Reebok Pump Fury OG “The Angry Bird” is an attention grabbing design and considering it is one of the last few Crooked Tongues collabs, is a collector’s choice for many of those with memories of the brand.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 338 - US$ 383",6.3,63.6

Of course A Bathing Ape, or Bape, has been one of the most popular brands from Japan since they were founded by Nigo in 1993, and one of their most recognizable design choices has been the use of camouflage. For this Pump Fury, they teamed up with Japanese retailer mita sneakers, one of the most popular collaborators in the sneaker world, to create one of the most popular Reebok Pump Fury designs of the 20th anniversary series. The design features olive, tan, brown combined in a camo upper that sits on top of a white midsole, making it somewhat of an instant classic. Bape has remained popular with celebs and this Pump Fury was no different, being seen on the feet of artists like Swizz Beatz, Fabolous and others. If you consider the popularity of the Reebok Pump Fury in Japan and the combination of two of the biggest names in sneakers and streetwear with mita and Bape, it should come as no surprise that the A Bathing Ape x mita x Reebok Pump Fury sold out instantly everywhere that it released in August of 2014.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 344 - US$ 456",14.1,73.9

Released in March of 2014 as part of Reebok's enormous celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Reebok InstaPump Fury, the shoe looks to luxury designer Boris Bidjan Saberi's $1400 ""Bamba"" high top sneaker and the Barcelona-based boutique for inspiration and a completely new take on the iconic silhouette. The result is a black and white graphic design that uses trompe l'oeil (optical illusion), subtle over-stitching, and geometric cuts to give the shoe totally new colorblocking. The Reebok InstaPump Fury was a project that began in 1992 and finally hit shelves in 1994. Bourne from a ""blue sky"" think tank for Reebok in the early 90s comprised of greats like Steve Burris, Peter Foley, and Paul Litchfield, the shoe was deisgned by Steven Smith. Smith is responsible for some of the greatest running shoes of all time including the New Balance 1500, 996, 997, 576, and Nike Air Max 2009. He also put the very first carbon fiber arch in a running shoe with the Reebok Graphlite Road. And thus, the Reebok InstaPump Fury sits atop a carbon fiber shank that actually holds most of the shoe together. The black stitching over the white stripes on the Reebok InstaPump Fury x 24 Kilates x 11 by Boris Bidjan Saberi are sure to turn heads everywhere.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)US$ 252 - US$ 308",NA,24.4

While the name “Pro Leather” might suggest a leather shoe, that’s not the case with this Concepts collaboration. The Converse Pro Leather originally released in 1976 as a basketball shoe and was worn by legendary hooper and hall of famer, Julius “Dr. J” Erving, among other NBA players. Nearly 20 years after its initial release, Concepts opted to flip the script on the Pro Leather and give the upper a knitted wool makeover. The “Aran Sweater” comes from Ireland and is traditionally an off white color similar to sheep’s wool and features unique and intricate cable patterns across the chest. With that in mind, Concepts gave the Pro Leather a uniquely designed wool upper with equally detailed cable patterns. The Converse Chevron logo gives this design its only color pop with a combination of green and orange on the side panel. Of course, a fully wool upper wouldn’t hold its structure so the heel is done in leather with the Concepts logo embossed into the heel panel. With Concepts’ Boston roots and Irish ties, the pairing with Converse, who keeps corporate offices in Beantown, makes the Concepts x Converse Pro Leather Hi “Aran Sweater” one of the most appropriate of collaborations.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)-- - --",NA,NA

Kasina moved far away from the roots of the Disc's technology-focused history and used luxurious materials like high-quality leather and beautiful deep, dark suede on the Disc Gucci. The Gucci Disc's upper reflects a color way often associated with luxury brand Gucci, with olive greens, bold reds, and pure black. While the Gucci Lux reminds many of luxury, it was able to seamlessly include the Disc fastening technology without looking alienated.

In hopes of capturing the market for those athletes who were ""on the run,"" the Disc fastening system was created to decrease lacing time. Building upon the classic silhouette and technical aspects of the Puma Disc, Kasina kicked things up a notch by using quilted leathers on the Egret. The Disc Egret's upper boasts a pure white quilted leather toe box, mid-foot underlay and heel paneling. While Egret Lux toe cap, made of beige leather, contrasts nicely against the white toe box yet is also subtle enough to be worn both on the track and off. Paired with another colorway, the ""Gucci,"" the Egret Lux was released in October of 2014 at a retail price of $160. Although some were turned off by the mix of luxurious materials paired with the plastic and composite fastening Disc system, many believe that Kasina's ambitious use of materials and design brought Disc technology back into 21st century fashion. Whether you like its aesthetics or not, the Kasina x Puma Disc Trinomial Lux ""Egret"" is undeniably luxurious.","Trade Range (12 Mos.)-- - --",NA,NA
